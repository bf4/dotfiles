 [CECUTIL V15 OR LATER REQUIRES VIMBALL V18 OR LATER FOR UNPACKING]

These routines are used by several of my utilities.  I'm loading them onto vim.sf.net to make it easier for GetLatestVimScripts to automate updates with them.

Marks:
     call SaveMark(markname)       let savemark= SaveMark(markname)
     call RestoreMark(markname)    call RestoreMark(savemark)
     call DestroyMark(markname)
     commands: SM RM DM

Window Position:
     call SaveWinPosn()        let winposn= SaveWinPosn()
     call RestoreWinPosn()     call RestoreWinPosn(winposn)
    \swp : save current window/buffer's position
    \rwp : restore current window/buffer's previous position
     commands: SWP RWP

User Maps:
    call SaveUserMaps(mapmode,maplead,mapchx,suffix)

    This function sets up a script-variable (ie. a variable that can generally be accessed only from within cecutil's own functions; see |s:|) called s:restoremap.  The selected user's maps are appended to this variable; the RestoreUserMaps() (|cecutil-restoreusermaps|) function uses the contents of this variable to restore user maps.

    Some examples follow:

        call SaveUserMaps("n","","webWEBjklh$0%;,nN","HiMtchBrkt")
            normal mode maps for w, e, b, W, E, B, j, k, l, etc
            (if any) are all saved in the variable
            s:restoremaps_HiMtchBrkt >

        call SaveUserMaps("n","","<up>","DrawIt")
            the normal mode map (if any) for the <up> key is saved in
            the variable s:restoremaps_DrawIt >

        call SaveUserMaps("n","",":F(","HiMtchBrkt")
            the normal mode map for F( (if any) is saved in the
            variable s:restoremaps_HiMtchBrkt

    call RestoreUserMaps(suffix)

        The usermaps saved by SaveUserMaps() with the given suffix will be restored (ie. s:restoremaps_{suffix}).  Example:

        call RestoreUserMaps("HiMtchBrkt")
            will restore all user maps redefined for the HiMtchBrkt plugin
