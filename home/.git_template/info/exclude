# git ls-files --others --exclude-from=.git/info/exclude
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# Added git_template/info/exclude for Xcode

# without an 'exclude' file. Created the exclude file to correspond to
# the existing gitignore file.
